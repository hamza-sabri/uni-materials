# Uni Mat (Universities Materials)

## Overview
**Uni Mat** is a transformative educational platform that centralizes university resources in Palestine, designed to significantly enhance the educational experience for students. This innovative platform consolidates essential academic materials, from lab reports to lecture videos, into a single, easily accessible location. By providing these resources, Uni Mat aims to empower students with the tools they need to succeed academically and encourage a more connected and resource-rich academic environment.

As the lead of the graduate team that developed Uni Mat, I've overseen the integration of advanced technologies and educational strategies to ensure that the platform is both powerful and user-friendly.

## Key Features
- **Centralized Resource Hub**: Uni Mat brings a vast array of educational materials into one platform, making it simpler for students to find and utilize the resources they need.
- **Rich Educational Content**: The platform hosts a diverse collection of materials, including detailed lab reports, summarized lectures, and extensive video tutorials, all curated to support a wide range of learning styles and needs.
- **Dynamic and Engaging Animations**: The frontend of Uni Mat uses sophisticated animation tools such as Framer Motion, GSAP, and LottieFiles to deliver a visually engaging experience that enhances user interaction and learning.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Developed with React and TypeScript, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase. The use of advanced animations makes the user interface intuitive and engaging.
- **Backend**: Utilizes a combination of Firebase, Node.js, and Express (all in TypeScript) for the main backend services, alongside a Python-based Flask microservice to efficiently handle specific tasks.
